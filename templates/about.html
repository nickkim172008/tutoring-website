  <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
    Hi, I’m Nicholas 👋 I’m a Grade 12 AP student with a passion for helping younger students succeed in math.
    I’ve completed Ontario’s most advanced math courses early, earning <strong>100% in both Advanced Functions
    and Calculus</strong>, and a <strong>5/5 on the AP Calculus AB exam</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
    With over <em>200 hours of tutoring experience</em>, I focus on making math clear and approachable,
    while building student confidence step by step.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
    Outside academics, I enjoy going to the gym, playing sports, hanging out with friends, and playing guitar.
